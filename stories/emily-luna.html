                    <!-- Introduction -->
                    <p class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-700">
                        Emily R. sat in her quiet apartment, scrolling through endless shelter websites, feeling completely overwhelmed. As a first-time cat owner, she had no idea where to start her search for a feline companion. The process felt daunting - dozens of shelters, hundreds of cats, and no guidance on which one might be right for her lifestyle.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "I knew I wanted to adopt, not shop," Emily recalls. "But every website had sad stories and blurry photos. I wanted to make the right choice, but I was terrified of picking a cat that wouldn't be happy with me, or worse, one I couldn't properly care for."
                    </p>

                    <div class="pull-quote">
                        "I was about to give up when a friend told me about Purrfect Match. Little did I know, my perfect companion was waiting just a swipe away."
                    </div>

                    <!-- Luna's Backstory -->
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-pink-600 mt-12 mb-6">Luna's Rags-to-Riches Story</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        Meanwhile, at the Sunshine Rescue Shelter, a petite black kitten named Luna was recovering from a rough start to life. Found abandoned in a cardboard box behind a grocery store, Luna was malnourished and scared of everything. The shelter staff worked patiently with her, helping her learn to trust humans again.
                    </p>

                    <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 my-8">
                        <div>

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        "Luna was one of our shyest residents," says Maria, the shelter manager. "She'd hide when volunteers approached, but we noticed she'd watch everything with those big, curious eyes. We knew she just needed the right person - someone patient who would let her come out of her shell on her own terms."
                    </p>

                    <!-- The Match -->
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-pink-600 mt-12 mb-6">The Purrfect Match</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        When Emily created her Purrfect Match profile, she was honest about being a first-time owner who worked from home and preferred quiet evenings. The algorithm immediately suggested cats that matched her calm lifestyle.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "Luna's profile stood out immediately," Emily says. "The bio mentioned she was 'energetic but gentle, with zoomies at 3am but cuddles all day.' It was honest and funny. The photos showed her playful side but also her sweet nature."
                    </p>

                    <div class="bg-pink-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">

                    <p>
                        Emily swiped right, and it was an instant match. The shelter contacted her within hours, and they arranged a meet-up that weekend.
                    </p>

                    <!-- The Meeting -->
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-pink-600 mt-12 mb-6">First Meeting Magic</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        "I was so nervous walking into the shelter," Emily admits. "But when I saw Luna peeking out from behind a cat tree, something clicked. She was cautious at first, but when I brought out the feather toy the shelter suggested, she couldn't resist."
                    </p>

                    <div class="w-full my-8">

                    <p>
                        Two weeks later, after completing the adoption process, Luna came home with Emily. The transition was smoother than either could have imagined.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Full Moon Zoomies Story -->
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-pink-600 mt-12 mb-6">Full Moon Frenzy: The Great Zoomie Incident</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        One of Luna's profile warnings proved particularly accurate: her legendary 3am zoomies. But nothing could have prepared Emily for the full moon edition.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "It was my first full moon with Luna," Emily laughs. "Around 2am, I woke up to what sounded like a tiny horse galloping through my apartment. I turned on the light to find Luna racing around the living room, bouncing off furniture like a pinball."
                    </p>

                    <div class="bg-pink-100 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
                        <p class="italic text-pink-700">"She'd run full-speed from the bedroom to the kitchen, slide across the floor, then immediately reverse direction. At one point, she tried to jump onto the bookshelf, missed, and landed in the laundry basket with a confused 'mrrrow?' It was the funniest thing I've ever seen."</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The zoomie session lasted a solid 45 minutes before Luna collapsed dramatically on the rug, as if saying, "Well, that's enough exercise for tonight." Emily snapped a photo of her sprawled out, which became one of her favorite memories.

                    <p>
                        Six months later, Emily and Luna have settled into a perfect routine. Luna still gets occasional zoomies (though they've moved to more reasonable hours), and Emily has become the confident cat owner she never thought she could be.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "Purrfect Match didn't just help me find a pet," Emily reflects. "It helped me find my perfect companion. The detailed profiles and matching system took the guesswork out of adoption and set us both up for success."
